machine learning approach for symbol error rate estimation

#### destination
	* 1. higher precision than care.
	* 2. as high as possible symbol error rate estimation rate. (>95% precision, >95% recall.)

## may have some challenge
	* 1. directly using current input information can not predict well (such as SINR, RSSI, Packet-RSSI, Packet-SNR)
	* 2. the online learning algorithm should be simple.
